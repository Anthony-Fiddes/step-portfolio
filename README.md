# STEP Portfolio

This is the portfolio I created as part of Google's Student Training in
Engineering Program (STEP). The full program I followed and original git history
can be found [here](https://github.com/Anthony-Fiddes/step-project), this is
just the portfolio portion. This portfolio can be easily adapted to create a
clean, sectioned resume to be hosted on Google Cloud.

# Features

- A simple, flexible styling made from scratch
- A comments section
  - Support for uploading images as part of comment
  - Support for using Google's translate API to translate all comments to
    English, Spanish, or Chinese
