This is the portfolio I created as part of Google's Student Training in
Engineering Program (STEP). The full program I followed can be found
[here](https://github.com/Anthony-Fiddes/step-project), this is just the portfolio portion.

The portfolio can be run with the following command:

```bash
mvn package appengine:run
```
