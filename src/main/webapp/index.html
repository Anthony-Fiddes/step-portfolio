        I'm an aspiring software engineer with a passion for figuring out how to
        create simple, elegant code! My current weapon of choice is Go, but I
        also enjoy working in Python or whatever the project demands!

        <p>
          I am pursuing a BS in Computer Science at Emory University. My
          coursework has primarily involved learning data structures and
          algorithms in Java
          and their underlying math and theory. They have also briefly addressed
          Assembly and C.
        </p>
        <h2>Relevant Coursework</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CS170 - Introduction to Computer Science I
          <li>CS171 - Introduction to Computer Science II
          <li>CS224 - Foundations of Computer Science (Discrete math)
          <li>CS253 - Data Structures and Algorithms
          <li>CS255 - Computer Architecture and Machine Level Programming

      <h2>Fare-Comparison</h2>
      <p>
        Fare Comparison is an AppEngine application that I contributed to while
        working in a team of three developers during Google’s 2018 Computer
        Science Summer Institute in Atlanta. It served as a way to quickly and
        easily compare Lyft and Uber prices for a given ride. It utilized Google
        APIs to implement location autocomplete, and to return a map of the
        fastest route between the inputted source and destination locations.
        Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript were all integral tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, as a result of a change in Lyft and Uber’s API policies,
        Fare Comparison no longer functions as intended.

        A group of Go command line tools designed to help users with ADHD to
        measure and manage their symptoms. This project will be heavily inspired
        by peer-reviewed literature. It will include tools for measuring
        distractibility, maintaining focus on a particular task, and ordering
        tasks by priority.

      <h1>Fun Stuff</h1>
      <p>
        You made it all the way to the bottom of my portfolio! Stay skeptical,
        sometimes the fun things in life require a bit of
        digging :). Here are some things I probably wouldn’t include on a
        regular resume!
      <ul>
        <li>At my Google internship in Chicago, I learned how to juggle
        <li>I enjoy playing DnD, particularly homebrew versions
        <li>I have a significant interest in personal finance (budgeting,
          credit, retirement) and love to share what I
          know with the people around me when they ask
        <li>My mom is Jamaican, so I can understand a bit of our national
          language, Patois
        <li>I learned a lot of the sounds of Spanish growing up in North Miami
          Beach, but I couldn’t roll my r’s until I
          was 18! It took months of daily practice
        <li>I’ve been doing problems on Project Euler since I was 14, but I only
          completed my first problem with a
          difficulty higher than 5% at 19! To be fair, I wasn’t particularly
          dedicated
        <li>He tomado cinco clases de español en mi universidad. Mi español no
          está en el nivel de un nativo, ¡pero es
          bastante bueno para mi!
        <li>I earned the small scar I have on my face in a battle over a blankie
          I had when I was 5
      </ul>
